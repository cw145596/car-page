<br>
<br>
<p>Track tuned and ready to rumble, the Camaro ZL1 has muscle-car dominance squarely in its sights. Both the coupe and the convertible house a ferocious 650-hp supercharged 6.2-liter V-8 donated by the Corvette Z06. Power is sent to the rear through either a six-speed manual or a 10-speed automatic and an electronic limited-slip differential, then scorches the pavement via 11-inch-wide rear wheels and tires. An 8.0-inch infotainment display is standard; a performance data recorder is optional.</p>

The 2017 ROUSH Stage 3 is truly the ultimate in American muscle. Jack Roush's vision shines through this perfect combination of raw power and meticulous handling and braking capabilities, providing the driver access to the robust attitude and performance of a race car, while maintaining a comfortable and uniquely "ROUSH" driving experience

 Between the flared front fenders is the most powerful production V8 ever offered. Engineers took the HellCat’s 6.2 liter V8 and topped it with a 2.8-liter supercharger. It is fed by a 1” fuel line that flows more than a showerhead. Full power is accessed by a programmer that comes in the Demon Crate, the $1 box of goodies that will have you ready to race. It unlocks the ability to run race fuel, another first in a production car.>

  <br>
  <p>As a targa or a convertible, the ZR1’s flamboyant bodywork clearly denotes it as the pinnacle of the Corvette lineup. Its supercharged 6.2-liter V-8 pushes a fierce 755 hp to the rear wheels; in our testing, the ZR1 went from zero to 60 mph in 3.1 seconds. The brakes are incredibly powerful, and the ZR1 grips the road with race-car intensity. That optional wing? It provides up to 950 pounds of downforce. The automatic is slow to shift, so get the manual transmission to better master this beast.

<p>The resurrected Ford GT is a track-focused hypercar that can hang with the best that Europe has to offer. When we first got a ride in the new GT, we declared that it "isn't just radical for a car wearing a Blue Oval badge, it's the razor's edge of automotive design." The new GT snagged the lap record at our annual Lightning Lap track test at Virginia International Raceway with a time of 2:43.0, although it held onto the record for only a few months. At the track, we found it to be "brutally fast, [forgoing] nearly all comforts in its quest for speed and cornering agility."</p>
