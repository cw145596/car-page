<br>
<br>
<p>Track tuned and ready to rumble, the Camaro ZL1 has muscle-car dominance squarely in its sights. Both the coupe and the convertible house a ferocious 650-hp supercharged 6.2-liter V-8 donated by the Corvette Z06. Power is sent to the rear through either a six-speed manual or a 10-speed automatic and an electronic limited-slip differential, then scorches the pavement via 11-inch-wide rear wheels and tires. An 8.0-inch infotainment display is standard; a performance data recorder is optional.</p>

The 2017 ROUSH Stage 3 is truly the ultimate in American muscle. Jack Roush's vision shines through this perfect combination of raw power and meticulous handling and braking capabilities, providing the driver access to the robust attitude and performance of a race car, while maintaining a comfortable and uniquely "ROUSH" driving experience

 Between the flared front fenders is the most powerful production V8 ever offered. Engineers took the HellCat’s 6.2 liter V8 and topped it with a 2.8-liter supercharger. It is fed by a 1” fuel line that flows more than a showerhead. Full power is accessed by a programmer that comes in the Demon Crate, the $1 box of goodies that will have you ready to race. It unlocks the ability to run race fuel, another first in a production car.>
